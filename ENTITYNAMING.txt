Entity Naming Scheme

Entities come in from the outside, appear in the world and are 
then manipulated by various world watchers (viewer, most likely). 
Each entity is given a string name for reference. Some of the 
other systems extend the name in a mappable way. For instance, 
a reference to an entity can be passed into one module by it's name and
the name is later passed back to search for the particular entity.

The general form of the entity name is:
	Host/LocalName[/Additions[.Type]]

where "LocalName" is the name the entity comes with from it's world. 
The "Host" is the name of the originator of the "LocalName" and it 
qualified the name to make it globally unique. "Additions" are added 
by various systems and they are usually added in such a way that he 
entity name can be reconstructed from the modified name (see below). 
"Type" is added by systems and is like "Additions".

For LLLP, "LocalName" is the UUID of the object and "Host" is the name of the
simulator it is from. The hostname is qualified to be a domain name:
	blueland.agni.secondlife.com/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

The entity names are managed by LookingGlass.World.EntityName and
any service specific conversion of the names (from basic entity name
to filename and back) are done in service specific conversion
classes (like "LookingGlass.Renderer.Ogre.EntityNameOgre"). This
keeps the name specific conversion code in centralized places rather
than letting it scatter around the application.

There are several Additions that are created by the Ogre Renderer:
	/MO
		Moveable object that is used to create the mesh. Should never be stored
	/Entity
		The name of the Ogre::Entity that the prim mesh is attached to
	-N.material
		the name of the material on the face N of the entity
	.mesh
		the name of the mesh created from the entity. This is turned into the
		filename where the mesh is stored/cached.
